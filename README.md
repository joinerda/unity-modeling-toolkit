Unity Modeling Toolkit

The Unity Modeling Toolkit is a collection of numerical analysis tools written in C#.

These tools are written primarily to extend numerical modeling and simulation capabilities with Unity game engine for educational purposes, paired with the Unity Visualization Toolkit, as part of the "World of Data" project which looks to facilitate visualization and modeling in VR environments.

Many of these tools have been developed to provide outreach opportunities to students new to programming, so that they can build a 3D numerical model and visualize it in VR in a single platform.
